# Guessing-game
The highLow.py program emulates a guessing game between the user and computer where the computer generates a random number within a specified range and the user attempts to guess the number by following the guidelines given by the computer as to whether their previous guess was too low, too high or correct.

The highLow2.py program runs the same game but flipped, where the user (you) pick a number within the specified range and the computer attempts to guess your number by following your guiidelines on whether its previous guess was too low (input 'l'), too high (input 'h') or correct (input 'c')
